# Personal Project: A Basic Shell in C

This shell can currently complete basic unix commands such as cat, ls, help and
cd. I found this project useful as it teaches some computer system principles
and shows what basically goes on under the hood in a shell, in a very basic
sense.

The folder 'src' contains the necessary files to run this project.
